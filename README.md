Hi there! My name is RAVI RANJAN CHAUBEY and I'm a Business Analyst at Genpact with a strong focus on Machine Learning. I'm proud to say that I'm also a Kaggle Master, with extensive experience in working on complex data science projects.

In addition to my work at Genpact, I'm also an active member of the data science community on Kaggle. As a Kaggle Master, I've competed in several data science competitions and have been recognized for my expertise in machine learning and data analytics.

When I'm not busy with work or Kaggle, I enjoy reading about the latest advancements in AI and machine learning, and experimenting with new tools and techniques to stay ahead of the curve.

Overall, I'm passionate about using data to drive meaningful insights and decisions, and I'm committed to continuously learning and growing in this field.
